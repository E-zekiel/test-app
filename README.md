When I’m away from you, I miss your touch (Ooh)
You’re the reason I believe in love
It's been difficult for me to trust (Ooh)
And I’m afraid that I'ma fuck it up
Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
'Cause you ain’t ever left me empty-handed
And you know that I know that I can't live without you
So, baby, stay

I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can’t find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey (Oh)
