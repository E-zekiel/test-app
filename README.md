When I’m away from you, I miss your touch (Ooh)
You’re the reason I believe in love
It's been difficult for me to trust (Ooh)
And I’m afraid that I'ma fuck it up
Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
'Cause you ain’t ever left me empty-handed
And you know that I know that I can't live without you
So, baby, stay

I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can’t find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey (Oh)

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it
But I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it
But I love it, oh

She told me, "Don't worry
About it"
She told me, "Don't worry
No more"
We both know we can't go
Without it
She told me, "You'll never
Be alo-oh-oh-ooh"
